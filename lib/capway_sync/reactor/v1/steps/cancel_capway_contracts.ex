defmodule CapwaySync.Reactor.V1.Steps.CancelCapwayContracts do
  @moduledoc """
  Identifies subscribers that need Capway contract cancellation.

  This step analyzes subscribers that exist in both Trinity and Capway systems
  but have had their payment method changed from "capway" to something else in Trinity.
  These contracts need to be cancelled in Capway since the payment method has changed.

  ## Input
  - `comparison_result`: Results from CompareData step containing cancel_capway_contracts list

  ## Output
  Returns a map containing:
  - `cancel_capway_contracts`: List of subscriber objects that need contract cancellation
  - `cancel_capway_count`: Count of contracts to cancel
  - `total_analyzed`: Total number of potential cancellation candidates analyzed

  ## Logic
  Processes subscribers identified in comparison_result.cancel_capway_contracts:
  - These are Trinity subscribers with payment_method != "capway"
  - Who still have active contracts in Capway
  - Requiring manual intervention or automated cancellation
